\arguments{
\item{history}{Data frame of simulation results including \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{time}, and opinion columns.}

\item{neighborhood}{List of neighbors for each agent.}

\item{opinion}{Character name of the column in \code{history} to use for node coloring (default "opinion1").}

\item{edge_col}{Color of edges (default "grey80").}

\item{node_size}{Numeric size of nodes (default 2).}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations for the force-directed layout per frame (default 200).}

\item{k}{Attraction strength between connected nodes (default 0.05).}

\item{repel}{Repulsion strength between all nodes (default 0.01).}

\item{delay}{Numeric; time delay between frames in seconds (default 0.2).}
}
\value{
NULL; produces an animated plot.

\description{
Creates an animation of a force-directed network of agents over multiple time steps,
showing node colors based on an opinion value and edges based on a neighborhood structure.
