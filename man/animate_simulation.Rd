\title{Animate simulation of agents over time}
\usage{
animate_simulation(
  sim_result,
  neighborhood = NULL,
  opinion = "opinion1",
  delay = 0.2,
  edges = TRUE,
  col_palette = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_result}{Data frame of simulation results including \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{time}, and opinion columns.}

\item{neighborhood}{Optional list of neighbors for each agent, as produced by a neighborhood function.}

\item{opinion}{Character name of the column in \code{sim_result} to use for coloring (default "opinion1").}

\item{delay}{Numeric; time delay between steps in seconds (default 0.2).}

\item{edges}{Logical; whether to draw lines connecting neighbors (default TRUE).}

\item{col_palette}{Optional color palette to use for mapping opinion values. If NULL, uses a blue-white-red palette of 100 colors.}
}
\value{
NULL; produces an animated plot.

\description{
Creates an animation of agents moving over time steps, optionally showing neighborhood connections
and coloring agents according to an opinion value.
