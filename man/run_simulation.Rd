\usage{
run_simulation(agents, neighborhood, steps = 30, rate = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{agents}{Data frame of agents with initial opinions and strengths.}

\item{neighborhood}{List of neighbors for each agent.}

\item{steps}{Integer number of simulation steps (default 30).}

\item{rate}{Numeric opinion update rate (default 0.4).}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Simulates the evolution of agent opinions over multiple time steps,
updating each agent's opinions based on the influence of its neighbors.
